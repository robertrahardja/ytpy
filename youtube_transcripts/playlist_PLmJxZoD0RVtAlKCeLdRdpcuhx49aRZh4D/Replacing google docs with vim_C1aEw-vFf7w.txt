when you learn Vim it's kind of the same
thing as getting married or having a kid
it's really awesome and lifechanging but
once it happens you can't really go back
to how it was before so if you try to
switch to something else like say not
having a kid you can't you you just
can't do it like once the Band-Aid is
ripped off it's just out there the state
has changed so that's what happened to
me in my junior year of high school I
learned vim and then we went back to
school for senior year
and I had to write stuff in Google Docs
not even Microsoft Office cuz my school
district was
broke and it was trash so um I went to
the Chrome web store and I tried to find
an extension to like give the Vim key
bindings in Google Docs but that didn't
exist at the time maybe it does now
but yeah so I just kind of gave up on on
having that dream until
I reached college and I found out there
are languages programming languages that
turn into
PDFs and there's markdown that's the
basic one there's latch and then there's
types and I use types now I used latch
for a little while but I wanted to make
this video kind of to people who are
where I was in high school and they want
to ditch Google Docs and use vim and I
can't blame you so here's my setup for
that I'm just going to create a blank
types file touch main. type classic name
um open that up I have a little snippet
for MLA formatting that give me the date
and whatever class let's say um
ambiguity
one Roman
numeral and then the professor like Todd
Baker or something just made that up and
this is just this is all right but it's
kind of like code like you know what I
mean and I can get a preview of
it with leader p in Vim I have
configured and that shows up nicely like
that now if I wanted like a centered
title I can just type a line and this is
in types Center and then open square
bracket close square
bracket
assignment struggling to spell there and
that looks all right and if I wanted
bold I think it's like that yeah tallic
might be
underscores it's kind of
typical yeah nice I remember how to do
it all right let's say we have some body
paragraphs just for stylistic
reasons so uh I'll generate some
sentences um just some big
Latin paste that in there um GQ wrap
that in fimm very nice don't get that in
Google Docs and
then paragraph uh D to the
bottom and how do I indent this again
indent first line indent maybe yeah uh
to
yeah
beautiful great looking first paragraph
and now
uh let's paste that a few times to show
what like a longer essay would look like
that's pretty solid the Vim motions plus
this is just so unbelievably creamy man
if I had this in high school probably
would have gone to Harvard just
saying
um yeah let's see what else is common to
do oh probably like a tap
maybe you can get that in types like
this so if I had a header another header
in reality this would be something you'd
actually it would be something like
relevant to the class thing you know
like price and time I don't know some
kind of table thing one
two three cursor is messing me up
for okay that's a little weird but um I
think that's because
columns is set to a weird
number set that to like
two boom
beautiful so there you could make any
arbitrary table that's pretty nice if
you wanted to export this to a PDF to
submit it I have um EP to export it to a
PDF I go like that open it up
GX and right there is a
PDF so that's nice but Google Docs has
lots of features and it has
collaborative editing collaborative
editing that's kind of where this falls
short because you can only collaborative
edit with other try
hards who know how to code a little bit
and are willing to use git if you want
like edit
history so that still needs some work
maybe you could fall back to Google Docs
there but
let's not dwell on that too
long this is like an honestly
submittable assignment right here you
know you could add more like what if you
wanted some spacing between this you
could spam new lines with the double
backspace oh single back space that
escapes it spaces between them there
that looks good you could also just #
vertical
to that
yeah maybe make this four you can read
all about this in uh the
types types website has documentation
for
everything
uh somewhere
here about
types types
docs
yeah I'm not going to go through it all
here
but you should know it's just it
supports everything that Google Docs
would plus much
more I want to see if there's a section
on layout this is
good direction fractional it's really
good at math too um math papers is what
it's kind of designed for but it'll do
really anything you could have a
multiple
columns set columns
to and go back to my preview Oh wrong
preview page there we
go okay well that did not
work I wonder why maybe it has to be up
here nope show
columns oh I have to put everything
inside the body of
it
oops what
okay well that did not work at
all oh maybe I don't I don't need the
set rule then if I do two yeah there we
go see some live
debugging yeah that looks awesome maybe
if you want that you could even do three
columns it's even
cooler uh but yeah color text tables
bibl ography is everything it has a ton
of
plugins I would totally learn it because
using
Vim it's worth any amount of other
learning like I would majorly
inconvenience myself to be slightly
faster um in the short
term yeah that's the moral
