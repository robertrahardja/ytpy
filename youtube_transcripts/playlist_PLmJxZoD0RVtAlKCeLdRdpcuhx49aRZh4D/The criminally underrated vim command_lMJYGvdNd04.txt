in Vim one of the most overpowered and
underrated commands has got to be normal
and I didn't know about this for a while
it's basically a super powerful find and
replace where you can do any kind of
arbitrary Vim script and run it on a
line by line basis so here's an example
of this is a very contrived example you
I'm just making up fake code basically
here but say that I have this list of
stuff and I could select it by um oops V
inside
uh open and curly bracket let me
actually turn on key casting
okay and then say that I want to add
append with parenthesis to each of these
terms you could do this with a macro you
could actually even do it with a find
and replace so like you could just
replace comma with do aend comma but the
way I'm going to do it
here is with Norm so type colon and then
norm and then you can type any Vim
motions so I'm going to go to the comma
with f comma and then now that I'm at
the commment I'm going to type I that'll
go into insert mode and then dot append
and then
parentheses then if I run that it'll add
do a pen to everything this is an actual
I'm going to stop my
LSP um so that's pretty cool just a good
find and replace but say that I wanted
to do something more complicated this
will actually showcase why this is so
powerful so if I go back to the
selection with go visual and then
capital V to select
everything I'm going to try to put all
of these variable names in quotes inside
the
append so let me think about how I would
do this this is just off the Dome um
first Norm now I'm going to go to the
beginning of the line with I can do with
underscore um and then I'm going to yank
word actually I'm going to yank to Dot
and
case for whatever reason word doesn't
doesn't capture everything so then I'll
be at at
period but now I want to go to the
closing
parentheses actually I want to go to the
opening parentheses and then
paste but I actually want quotes inside
here so what I'm going to do is insert
actually a because I'm on the opening
one and I want to insert it the next
character so then I'll hit quotes and
now to go back into normal
mode you can hit control
V and then escape and that character
will put you back inside normal mode and
now I can hit paste and then a and
then close close hopefully this works
enter boom so that's an awesome use
case um you could probably use a large
language model now but uh you won't feel
as good about it one more cool thing is
say that you have a macro let's make a
basic one
qw and let's have this yank inside
quotes and then go to the end and then
paste it three
times and then add a pipe at the end and
then close that
macro what some people would do is try
to
go down each line and then run that
another time and then they'd see like
okay so there's six lines and let's do
six at w it's not going to work cuz I
don't have I don't have a j to go down
what I do now instead of that is I
select the whole block that I
want and then I type norm and then add W
and that'll run it per line and there
you go three paste and then a bar for
each one sorry this example was kind of
bizarre it's not valid code um at all
