in this video i'm going to explain in this video i'm going to explain exactly how top consulting firms like exactly how top consulting firms like mckinsey vane and bcg use the pyramid mckinsey vane and bcg use the pyramid principle to create clear and insightful principle to create clear and insightful slides i'll review slides from each firm slides i'll review slides from each firm and show you how the pyramid principle and show you how the pyramid principle is reflected and why it makes the slide is reflected and why it makes the slide more effective more effective all that and more coming up all that and more coming up [Music] [Music] [Music] hi everyone paul here with the analyst hi everyone paul here with the analyst academy where we teach people how to academy where we teach people how to create high quality consulting style create high quality consulting style presentations to learn more about the presentations to learn more about the courses we provide for teams or courses we provide for teams or individual learners visit us at individual learners visit us at theanalystacademy.com i'm going to theanalystacademy.com i'm going to review three different slides today and review three different slides today and each one is going to be more complicated each one is going to be more complicated than the last i'll start with a pretty than the last i'll start with a pretty straightforward slide from bcg then move straightforward slide from bcg then move on to a slightly more complicated slide on to a slightly more complicated slide from mckinsey then an even more from mckinsey then an even more complicated slide from bain complicated slide from bain the slides themselves are not difficult the slides themselves are not difficult to understand but how they've applied to understand but how they've applied the pyramid principle is what might not the pyramid principle is what might not be so clear be so clear and of course these slides are from and of course these slides are from publicly available sources so we'll make publicly available sources so we'll make sure to include a link to them in the sure to include a link to them in the description before we get into the description before we get into the slides i want to give a quick recap of slides i want to give a quick recap of what the pyramid principle is what the pyramid principle is put simply the pyramid principle is put simply the pyramid principle is really just a structured way of really just a structured way of communicating your ideas where you start communicating your ideas where you start with your main point then work your way with your main point then work your way through the supporting details of that through the supporting details of that main point main point and it's represented pretty well with a and it's represented pretty well with a pyramid because you start right here at pyramid because you start right here at the top of the pyramid and then move the top of the pyramid and then move down to the bottom with more supporting down to the bottom with more supporting details and data so let's take a look at details and data so let's take a look at a quick example a quick example let's say i'm trying to communicate the let's say i'm trying to communicate the idea that lebron james is my favorite idea that lebron james is my favorite player player player so i'm going to start with that main so i'm going to start with that main point by saying that right at the point by saying that right at the beginning whether i'm doing this in an beginning whether i'm doing this in an email or it's face-to-face communication email or it's face-to-face communication or in a presentation or in a presentation and then i'm going to give you my three and then i'm going to give you my three key arguments for why he's my favorite key arguments for why he's my favorite player player player and then for each of those i can provide and then for each of those i can provide supporting details supporting details i can tell you that he has a career i can tell you that he has a career average of 27 points per game and he's average of 27 points per game and he's the third highest all-time scorer the third highest all-time scorer and that's going to support the idea and that's going to support the idea here that he scores a lot of points here that he scores a lot of points which is just one of my key arguments to which is just one of my key arguments to show you that lebron james is my show you that lebron james is my favorite player favorite player and this works well in a variety of and this works well in a variety of settings whether that's email settings whether that's email face-to-face communication or in your face-to-face communication or in your powerpoint presentations at a deck level powerpoint presentations at a deck level but also at an individual slide level but also at an individual slide level and the individual slide level is what and the individual slide level is what we're going to focus on today we're going to focus on today so the first of these examples that so the first of these examples that we're going to talk about is bcg we're going to talk about is bcg this slide is a great example of the this slide is a great example of the pyramid principle because it's really pyramid principle because it's really well structured and clear well structured and clear the title of the slide says melbourne the title of the slide says melbourne seen as a cultural and creative city seen as a cultural and creative city now that's the main point that they're now that's the main point that they're trying to communicate to me and they've trying to communicate to me and they've split that main point up into two key split that main point up into two key arguments as represented here on the arguments as represented here on the left left left melbourne perceived by australians as melbourne perceived by australians as the country's leading cultural city the country's leading cultural city and this one on the right international and this one on the right international travelers also perceive melbourne as a travelers also perceive melbourne as a creative city creative city and then you can take it one level and then you can take it one level deeper so notice how for each of these deeper so notice how for each of these you have four supporting points you have four supporting points you can see this clearly represented you can see this clearly represented when we put it next to the pyramid when we put it next to the pyramid the main point is the title right here the main point is the title right here these key arguments are represented in these key arguments are represented in the subtitle and these all make up the the subtitle and these all make up the supporting points so the supporting supporting points so the supporting points support the subtitle the subtitle points support the subtitle the subtitle supports the title and it's all very supports the title and it's all very clear i don't wonder at all how they clear i don't wonder at all how they reach their conclusions and the other reach their conclusions and the other benefit here is it's easy for me to benefit here is it's easy for me to process the information on the slide process the information on the slide with data heavy slides you can get a lot with data heavy slides you can get a lot of information thrown at you all at once of information thrown at you all at once and if you're sitting in a live and if you're sitting in a live presentation it can be hard to presentation it can be hard to understand all the data listen to what understand all the data listen to what the speaker's saying and think of a the speaker's saying and think of a response so they've organized the response so they've organized the information in a way that makes it as information in a way that makes it as clear as possible clear as possible they want you to look here first so you they want you to look here first so you understand the overarching idea then go understand the overarching idea then go into the details into the details that way you have the right context to that way you have the right context to read through their key arguments and you read through their key arguments and you can dive into the data and reading can dive into the data and reading through it this way makes it clear through it this way makes it clear simple and easy to understand the next simple and easy to understand the next slide from mckinsey is also fairly slide from mckinsey is also fairly straightforward it's from a deck about straightforward it's from a deck about high-growth emerging economies which high-growth emerging economies which they refer to as outperforming economies they refer to as outperforming economies and this slide shows three areas that and this slide shows three areas that have propelled the growth for these have propelled the growth for these emerging economies emerging economies so if we read the title it says a so if we read the title it says a pro-growth agenda of productivity income pro-growth agenda of productivity income and demand propel the outperforming and demand propel the outperforming economies economies economies and then there's some data on this slide and then there's some data on this slide and this nice visual in the middle so and this nice visual in the middle so it's pretty easy to spot the different it's pretty easy to spot the different layers in the pyramid layers in the pyramid so obviously just like in our last slide so obviously just like in our last slide the main point is going to be the main point is going to be represented by the title here represented by the title here this is what they want you to understand this is what they want you to understand and take away from the slide and then and take away from the slide and then the key argument is also pretty clear the key argument is also pretty clear you've got productivity income and you've got productivity income and demand shown here in the title and those demand shown here in the title and those match up with these different sections match up with these different sections productivity productivity productivity demand demand demand and income right here and then of course and income right here and then of course for each of those different key for each of those different key arguments you've got supporting points arguments you've got supporting points so this was organized in a little bit so this was organized in a little bit different way visually than our bcg different way visually than our bcg slide but the structure is definitely slide but the structure is definitely still there and this again just goes to still there and this again just goes to show you how consulting firms use the show you how consulting firms use the pyramid principle to organize their pyramid principle to organize their ideas so that you can process the ideas so that you can process the information quickly and you understand information quickly and you understand how they reached each of their how they reached each of their conclusions it's simple it's effective conclusions it's simple it's effective and it's very clear and it's very clear then lastly we have a slide from bain then lastly we have a slide from bain and this one is slightly more and this one is slightly more complicated than the first two we complicated than the first two we actually did a full breakdown of this actually did a full breakdown of this slide so if you're interested in going a slide so if you're interested in going a few levels deeper and exploring some of few levels deeper and exploring some of the other elements of the slide make the other elements of the slide make sure you check it out so this slide is sure you check it out so this slide is all about the luxury goods market in all about the luxury goods market in china and what they're trying to show is china and what they're trying to show is that it's growing but then not only that that it's growing but then not only that they're trying to highlight where the they're trying to highlight where the growth is coming from the title says growth is coming from the title says greater than 60 of growth in 2011 greater than 60 of growth in 2011 continue to come from new customers continue to come from new customers however share from existing customers however share from existing customers improved improved improved and when we look at the slide in terms and when we look at the slide in terms of the pyramid principle this is of the pyramid principle this is obviously our main point obviously our main point but one of the things that's tricky but one of the things that's tricky about this slide is that the key about this slide is that the key arguments are not so clear in our bcg arguments are not so clear in our bcg slide they were organized neatly into slide they were organized neatly into the left and right sections of the slide the left and right sections of the slide and in the mckinsey slide they were and in the mckinsey slide they were clearly bolded with bullet points clearly bolded with bullet points underneath but in this example they underneath but in this example they aren't really in the main body of the aren't really in the main body of the slide if you look at the title it's slide if you look at the title it's talking about growth coming from new talking about growth coming from new customers and from existing customers so customers and from existing customers so comparing this next to our pyramid the comparing this next to our pyramid the main point is shown here in the title main point is shown here in the title but the key arguments are actually going but the key arguments are actually going to be that growth is coming from new to be that growth is coming from new customers that's our first key argument customers that's our first key argument and existing customers which is our and existing customers which is our second key second key even though that's not represented in even though that's not represented in the body of the slide with subtitles or the body of the slide with subtitles or bolded text or something like that bolded text or something like that but if you look at the body of the slide but if you look at the body of the slide you can start to see supporting points you can start to see supporting points that fall into one of these two that fall into one of these two categories categories categories let's take a look at the waterfall chart let's take a look at the waterfall chart for example for example the waterfall chart is basically just the waterfall chart is basically just showing where the growth came from from showing where the growth came from from 2009 to 2010 2009 to 2010 and then from 2010 to the estimated and then from 2010 to the estimated number in 2011. number in 2011. so the growth of the new customers is in so the growth of the new customers is in red which falls into our first key red which falls into our first key argument argument argument and then growth from existing customers and then growth from existing customers is in this dark gray color which falls is in this dark gray color which falls into our second key argument into our second key argument then onto the right side of the slide we then onto the right side of the slide we have bullet points that provide support have bullet points that provide support for the first key argument these two for the first key argument these two right here about new customers right here about new customers and then we have bullet points that and then we have bullet points that provide support for the second key provide support for the second key argument these two right here every argument these two right here every element of the slide has a purpose and element of the slide has a purpose and that purpose is to in some way support that purpose is to in some way support the main message the main message so just like the other slides it makes so just like the other slides it makes this slide even though it's organized a this slide even though it's organized a little bit differently little bit differently easy to follow and it makes it easy to easy to follow and it makes it easy to understand how they reached each of understand how they reached each of their conclusions which in a consulting their conclusions which in a consulting or executive environment is critical or executive environment is critical that's going to do it for today's video that's going to do it for today's video i hope you found it helpful if you're i hope you found it helpful if you're
