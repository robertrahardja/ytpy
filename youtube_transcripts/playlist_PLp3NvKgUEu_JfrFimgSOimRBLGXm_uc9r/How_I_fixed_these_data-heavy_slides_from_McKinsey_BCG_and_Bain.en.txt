I took three data heavy slides one from I took three data heavy slides one from Mackenzie one from Bane and one from BCG Mackenzie one from Bane and one from BCG to see if I could make them even better to see if I could make them even better in this video I'm going to walk through in this video I'm going to walk through each of the changes that I made and show each of the changes that I made and show you the final result coming you the final result coming [Music] up hi everybody my name is Paul and I'm up hi everybody my name is Paul and I'm an instructor at analyst Academy where an instructor at analyst Academy where we teach people and teams how to build we teach people and teams how to build better presentations based on best better presentations based on best practices from the Consulting industry practices from the Consulting industry so if that sounds like something you're so if that sounds like something you're interested in make sure you check out interested in make sure you check out our courses at the analyst academy.com a our courses at the analyst academy.com a quick note before we get started all of quick note before we get started all of the slides that I use today are from the slides that I use today are from publicly available sources so if you're publicly available sources so if you're interested in checking out the original interested in checking out the original slide or the original report make sure slide or the original report make sure you check those out in the links down you check those out in the links down below there you can also find a direct below there you can also find a direct link to our data visualization course link to our data visualization course where you can essentially learn to do where you can essentially learn to do exactly what I'm doing in this video exactly what I'm doing in this video today all right this first slide is a today all right this first slide is a slide from BCG title says Industries slide from BCG title says Industries with lowest future work Readiness have with lowest future work Readiness have highest share of deathless workers so highest share of deathless workers so they have a combination chart here which they have a combination chart here which in this case is a line chart combined in this case is a line chart combined with a column chart they're trying to with a column chart they're trying to show the data in the same space and show the data in the same space and usually you do that when the data is in usually you do that when the data is in some way related to each other as in some way related to each other as in this case so the line chart shows the this case so the line chart shows the future of work Readiness by industry so future of work Readiness by industry so for example insurance on the scale from for example insurance on the scale from this line to this line insurance is this line to this line insurance is about right here and they kind of give a about right here and they kind of give a little bit of detail into their little bit of detail into their methodology in the footnotes but it's methodology in the footnotes but it's not a whole lot of information and then not a whole lot of information and then the other thing that there showing is a the other thing that there showing is a lot more straightforward which is the lot more straightforward which is the share of deathless workers and that's share of deathless workers and that's indicated by this column chart down here indicated by this column chart down here so Professional Services has 15% of so Professional Services has 15% of people are working desk list so there's people are working desk list so there's a few major things about this chart that a few major things about this chart that I don't really like but there's actually I don't really like but there's actually a lot of things about the chart that I a lot of things about the chart that I do like one thing for example is I like do like one thing for example is I like that they've removed anything of the that they've removed anything of the chart that isn't necessary so in this chart that isn't necessary so in this case for example for the share of desist case for example for the share of desist workers they've got the values right in workers they've got the values right in the columns themselves so to put an axis the columns themselves so to put an axis on this chart right here would just add on this chart right here would just add to the distraction another thing they've to the distraction another thing they've done really well is to draw attention to done really well is to draw attention to the things on the chart that matter the the things on the chart that matter the most when you're building your chart the most when you're building your chart the goal is you want to simplify it as much goal is you want to simplify it as much as possible and then draw attention to as possible and then draw attention to the parts of the chart that are going to the parts of the chart that are going to illustrate your illustrate your message this right here is a textbook message this right here is a textbook example of that they've put a box around example of that they've put a box around this section to indicate which this section to indicate which Industries are leaders and another box Industries are leaders and another box to show which Industries are laggers and to show which Industries are laggers and again this helps me Focus my attention again this helps me Focus my attention on the parts of this chart that matter on the parts of this chart that matter the most my main gripe at this slide is the most my main gripe at this slide is that they decided to use a combination that they decided to use a combination chart and combination charts can be chart and combination charts can be great it's a great place to show two great it's a great place to show two different data sets in the same space different data sets in the same space especially when one of those data sets especially when one of those data sets provides context for the other but in provides context for the other but in this case they're trying to use a this case they're trying to use a combination chart to show the combination chart to show the relationship between two data sets in relationship between two data sets in other words when one does this the other other words when one does this the other one does this and for that a scatter one does this and for that a scatter plot is usually a much better choice the plot is usually a much better choice the other thing is I think this line right other thing is I think this line right here is a little bit here is a little bit misleading so line charts are usually misleading so line charts are usually pretty good when you're trying to show pretty good when you're trying to show Trends or patterns in the data that's Trends or patterns in the data that's because unlike a column or a bar chart because unlike a column or a bar chart that shows individual separate data that shows individual separate data points this connects them all together points this connects them all together so it's a lot easier for the audience to so it's a lot easier for the audience to see the trend or the pattern or what see the trend or the pattern or what have you so when I look at this my brain have you so when I look at this my brain naturally wants to find that pattern naturally wants to find that pattern which is a pattern of growth but that's which is a pattern of growth but that's obviously a problem because this isn't a obviously a problem because this isn't a pattern of growth they've just sorted pattern of growth they've just sorted this data from low to high but back to this data from low to high but back to my other point a scatter plot is going my other point a scatter plot is going to be a much better choice here because to be a much better choice here because we can see the relationship instead of we can see the relationship instead of relying on how big this Gap is or how relying on how big this Gap is or how small this Gap is we'll be able to plot small this Gap is we'll be able to plot these against two different axes so here these against two different axes so here we have the exact same data only plotted we have the exact same data only plotted along our two axes and as you can tell along our two axes and as you can tell there's a general relationship in other there's a general relationship in other words if we read the title again words if we read the title again Industries with lower future work Industries with lower future work Readiness have higher share of deathless Readiness have higher share of deathless workers you can see that that is indeed workers you can see that that is indeed correct in other words when future of correct in other words when future of work Readiness tends to be low then work Readiness tends to be low then share of deathless workers tends to be share of deathless workers tends to be high which is this section right here so high which is this section right here so now that we've kind of stripped this now that we've kind of stripped this down we've chosen the right chart it's down we've chosen the right chart it's time to put a little bit more focus on time to put a little bit more focus on what we want our audience to what we want our audience to see so now we have our leaders and our see so now we have our leaders and our laggards laggards again people with low laggards laggards again people with low future work Readiness and high future work Readiness and high percentage of deathless workers and then percentage of deathless workers and then the leaders with high future work the leaders with high future work Readiness but low percentage of Readiness but low percentage of deathless workers well now I think deathless workers well now I think there's maybe too much going on so let's there's maybe too much going on so let's simplify it even more draw attention simplify it even more draw attention away from the things that don't matter away from the things that don't matter as much and draw attention to things as much and draw attention to things that do matter more in this case the that do matter more in this case the title is about this section right here title is about this section right here it's not about this section it's not it's not about this section it's not about these gaps so that's what we want about these gaps so that's what we want to emphasize so by keeping this kind of to emphasize so by keeping this kind of gray section right here and moving these gray section right here and moving these to the corners we put an emphasis on to the corners we put an emphasis on that by deemphasizing everything else so that by deemphasizing everything else so if you compare with our original slide if you compare with our original slide my opinion it looks a whole lot better my opinion it looks a whole lot better the chart clearly emphasizes the message the chart clearly emphasizes the message it puts attention on things that matter it puts attention on things that matter and takes it away from the things that and takes it away from the things that don't matter all right this next slide don't matter all right this next slide is from Mackenzie and it's about is from Mackenzie and it's about Mexico's chemical industry title says Mexico's chemical industry title says Mexico has access to a large volume of Mexico has access to a large volume of available plastic waste feed stock so available plastic waste feed stock so the chart is a 100% stacked bar chart the chart is a 100% stacked bar chart and it's meant to show the plastic waste and it's meant to show the plastic waste end of life management for these end of life management for these different countries and obviously the different countries and obviously the emphasis here is on Mexico so looking at emphasis here is on Mexico so looking at the legend you can see these four the legend you can see these four different options for what happens to different options for what happens to plastic waste in these different plastic waste in these different countries when I first looked at this countries when I first looked at this chart I was a little bit confused chart I was a little bit confused because the title talks about available because the title talks about available plastic waste feed stock but I wasn't plastic waste feed stock but I wasn't sure which sections of These Bars sure which sections of These Bars represent available plastic waste feed represent available plastic waste feed stock so is it these three is it these stock so is it these three is it these two is it just landfill is it just two is it just landfill is it just Recycling and the reason why I was Recycling and the reason why I was confused is because of the color scheme confused is because of the color scheme so McKenzie has a beautiful color scheme so McKenzie has a beautiful color scheme where I think someone at who works at where I think someone at who works at Mackenzie might have to correct me but I Mackenzie might have to correct me but I think this black color is their kind of think this black color is their kind of primary first color and then it's always primary first color and then it's always accented with this blue color and you accented with this blue color and you got a few other Blues in there so what got a few other Blues in there so what they're trying to show is that these two they're trying to show is that these two bars bars bars matter and then all these other ones matter and then all these other ones like this and these two and whatever like this and these two and whatever they're grayed out to kind of be they're grayed out to kind of be deemphasized and I think they had the deemphasized and I think they had the right intentions here but the problem is right intentions here but the problem is black is a confusing color in a chart black is a confusing color in a chart because it's not really a background because it's not really a background color as much as you might think it is color as much as you might think it is it does still stand out but it's also it does still stand out but it's also not really a foreground color either not really a foreground color either it's kind of this in between so when it's kind of this in between so when they put it in this bar chart right here they put it in this bar chart right here it's hard for me to know are they it's hard for me to know are they emphasizing this whole section or is it emphasizing this whole section or is it just this blue section or is it just this blue section or is it something else so I think that's the something else so I think that's the first thing to fix about this chart I first thing to fix about this chart I think that can be made a lot more think that can be made a lot more clear so what I did is I just clear so what I did is I just deemphasized these Grays a little bit deemphasized these Grays a little bit it's technically the same color I just it's technically the same color I just added some opacity to it to make it make added some opacity to it to make it make these two bars or these two categories these two bars or these two categories stand out just a little bit more the stand out just a little bit more the obvious downside to this is that might obvious downside to this is that might not technically fit with their color not technically fit with their color scheme but in my opinion this emphasizes scheme but in my opinion this emphasizes the message a whole lot better and so the message a whole lot better and so needs to be done next thing I think that needs to be done next thing I think that needs to be done with this slide is to needs to be done with this slide is to emphasize the title just a little bit emphasize the title just a little bit more especially when you have other text more especially when you have other text on the slide that's the same color and on the slide that's the same color and pretty close and size so that's the next pretty close and size so that's the next thing I did was to emphasize this title thing I did was to emphasize this title just a little bit more now when people just a little bit more now when people look at this slide they're going to look at this slide they're going to hopefully read the title first and hopefully read the title first and that'll give them context for the rest that'll give them context for the rest of the data on the slide the other thing of the data on the slide the other thing I did here was to add these percent I did here was to add these percent signs right here I know I didn't do it signs right here I know I didn't do it throughout the whole chart but I think throughout the whole chart but I think right here adding these percent signs right here adding these percent signs even if that's against McKenzie's even if that's against McKenzie's formatting guidelines I think it makes formatting guidelines I think it makes this a lot more clear because this is a this a lot more clear because this is a pretty important section right here this pretty important section right here this capturable plastic waste and to put capturable plastic waste and to put percentages to of these helps me percentages to of these helps me associate it with this section A lot associate it with this section A lot more so as the slide is right now I more so as the slide is right now I think it's pretty good there's a nice think it's pretty good there's a nice connection between the title and what's connection between the title and what's emphasized with the colors but I think emphasized with the colors but I think the message could be emphasized just a the message could be emphasized just a little bit more so what I did was I little bit more so what I did was I mooved this Legend down to the bottom mooved this Legend down to the bottom but made it just a little bit bigger and but made it just a little bit bigger and then added this section right here that then added this section right here that clearly explains so there's no confusion clearly explains so there's no confusion for dumb people like me who didn't for dumb people like me who didn't understand which part is talking about understand which part is talking about the C capturable plastic waste and that the C capturable plastic waste and that again connects with the title so in my again connects with the title so in my opinion this is a whole lot more clear opinion this is a whole lot more clear but we could probably if we wanted to but we could probably if we wanted to take it one step further and just take it one step further and just emphasize this just a little bit more so emphasize this just a little bit more so I made it red that's more of a personal I made it red that's more of a personal preference uh but to me this makes it a preference uh but to me this makes it a lot more clear and again connects with lot more clear and again connects with the title pretty well so if you compare the title pretty well so if you compare this with the original version we're this with the original version we're drawing attention away from the parts of drawing attention away from the parts of the chart that don't matter drawing the chart that don't matter drawing attention to the parts of the chart that attention to the parts of the chart that do matter the most and trying to make do matter the most and trying to make the con connection with the title just a the con connection with the title just a little bit more clear all right this is little bit more clear all right this is a slide from Bane about the global a slide from Bane about the global private Equity Market title says deal private Equity Market title says deal value surge globally but the biggest value surge globally but the biggest increases came in North America as increases came in North America as investors flocked to Tech sectors investors flocked to Tech sectors concentrated in the US and this is a concentrated in the US and this is a really really goodlooking slide you got really really goodlooking slide you got three combination charts that show two three combination charts that show two separate things they show quarterly bi separate things they show quarterly bi out deal value represented by these gray out deal value represented by these gray columns right here and they also show columns right here and they also show the deal count represented by this red the deal count represented by this red line and it's broken out into North line and it's broken out into North America Europe Asia Pacific one thing America Europe Asia Pacific one thing that Bane consistently does really well that Bane consistently does really well is they deemphasize the parts of their is they deemphasize the parts of their chart that don't matter and really put chart that don't matter and really put into Focus the parts of the chart that into Focus the parts of the chart that do matter so it took me a while of do matter so it took me a while of really staring at this slide to figure really staring at this slide to figure out what I could do to improve it and I out what I could do to improve it and I was reading the title and I noticed a was reading the title and I noticed a few things in the title that kind of few things in the title that kind of tipped me off to how this could be tipped me off to how this could be improved so the title should give you an improved so the title should give you an indication for what you should focus on indication for what you should focus on in your chart or in your slide here in your chart or in your slide here there's three things that I feel like there's three things that I feel like they don't really emphasize that they don't really emphasize that much the first deal value remember what much the first deal value remember what I said earlier about emphasizing things I said earlier about emphasizing things that matter and deemphasizing things that matter and deemphasizing things that don't matter in this chart they're that don't matter in this chart they're emphasizing the count by using a red emphasizing the count by using a red line that stands in contrast to the gray line that stands in contrast to the gray Lin they're not Lin they're not emphasizing the actual deal value the emphasizing the actual deal value the second thing is they talk about big second thing is they talk about big increases once again line charts are increases once again line charts are good for showing patterns and one of good for showing patterns and one of those patterns can be an increase over those patterns can be an increase over time if this message said something time if this message said something about Q4 2021 being better than Q3 then about Q4 2021 being better than Q3 then a column chart would be great for that a column chart would be great for that because you can compare the lengths of because you can compare the lengths of the columns really easily it emphasizes the columns really easily it emphasizes that message but here they're talking that message but here they're talking about a change they're trying to say about a change they're trying to say that there's an increase right here that that there's an increase right here that doesn't really get emphasized with a doesn't really get emphasized with a column chart it'd be much better with a column chart it'd be much better with a line chart and then the last thing is line chart and then the last thing is this focus on North America they do a this focus on North America they do a pretty good job of separating North pretty good job of separating North America out but it's kind of hard to America out but it's kind of hard to compare North America with Europe and compare North America with Europe and Asia Pacific so it's hard to really see Asia Pacific so it's hard to really see the Rel relative change between those the Rel relative change between those three areas so one way we can solve this three areas so one way we can solve this is by taking the most important data is by taking the most important data deal value and putting that into its own deal value and putting that into its own line chart along with these other two line chart along with these other two regions so I know this changes the chart regions so I know this changes the chart quite a bit but to me this puts a much quite a bit but to me this puts a much bigger emphasis on the three things that bigger emphasis on the three things that we talked about first of all this chart we talked about first of all this chart is all about deal value secondly this is all about deal value secondly this biggest increas is really gets biggest increas is really gets emphasized with this line right here and emphasized with this line right here and then lastly the focus on North America then lastly the focus on North America is very clear because you can compare is very clear because you can compare North America with Europe and with Asia North America with Europe and with Asia Pacific by the way one just side note Pacific by the way one just side note here notice how I put these right next here notice how I put these right next to the line themselves instead of in a to the line themselves instead of in a legend it's a lot more clear it's easier legend it's a lot more clear it's easier to reference the data and if you can to reference the data and if you can color them the same color as your lines color them the same color as your lines then again that's going to make it that then again that's going to make it that much more easy for the much more easy for the audience so the obvious missing piece audience so the obvious missing piece here is in the deal count and again that here is in the deal count and again that provides context for the information it provides context for the information it doesn't necessarily need to be doesn't necessarily need to be emphasized but it could be helpful to emphasized but it could be helpful to know so I guess that's kind of the know so I guess that's kind of the drawback of using the line chart but one drawback of using the line chart but one way around that is to include the way around that is to include the information below the chart down here so information below the chart down here so that's what I did I moved this chart up that's what I did I moved this chart up and added some more information but and added some more information but there's a couple more things that I did there's a couple more things that I did to try and make this even just a little to try and make this even just a little bit more clear first thing was to make bit more clear first thing was to make the connection between this quarterly the connection between this quarterly buyout deal value and deal count just a buyout deal value and deal count just a little bit more strong again I'm not little bit more strong again I'm not trying to show the visual relationship trying to show the visual relationship here we did away with that by deleting here we did away with that by deleting the combination charts and putting a the combination charts and putting a line chart here but I do want to show line chart here but I do want to show some connection so the way I did that some connection so the way I did that was to make the colors the same and then was to make the colors the same and then lastly I just kind of scrunch this table lastly I just kind of scrunch this table down a little bit so what I did was just down a little bit so what I did was just try to deemphasize things that don't try to deemphasize things that don't matter like these footnotes down here matter like these footnotes down here and kind of scrunch the table a little and kind of scrunch the table a little bit to really put the focus on this bit to really put the focus on this chart and particularly this section of chart and particularly this section of the chart because again that's what the chart because again that's what they're trying to emphasize based on they're trying to emphasize based on what they put in the title so if you what they put in the title so if you compare this with the original version compare this with the original version to me this emphasizes the message a to me this emphasizes the message a whole lot better but of course that whole lot better but of course that comes at a cost I don't think this is comes at a cost I don't think this is necessarily as visually appealing and necessarily as visually appealing and you lose some of the information around you lose some of the information around deal count but again I think that cost deal count but again I think that cost is worth it and I think this is a much is worth it and I think this is a much better slide all right that's going to better slide all right that's going to do it for today's video I hope you found do it for today's video I hope you found it helpful let me know your thoughts it helpful let me know
