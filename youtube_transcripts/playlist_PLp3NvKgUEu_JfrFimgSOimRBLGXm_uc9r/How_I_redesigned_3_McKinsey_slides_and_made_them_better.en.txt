I took three slides from the most I took three slides from the most prestigious consulting firm maybe the prestigious consulting firm maybe the most prestigious company in the world to most prestigious company in the world to see if I could make them even better in see if I could make them even better in this video I'm going to walk through this video I'm going to walk through exactly what I did why I did it and why exactly what I did why I did it and why I think you can do the same thing to I think you can do the same thing to director and analyst Academy where we director and analyst Academy where we teach people and teams how to build teach people and teams how to build better presentations based on best better presentations based on best practices from the Consulting industry practices from the Consulting industry so if that sounds like something you're so if that sounds like something you're interested in make sure you check out interested in make sure you check out our courses at theanalystacademy.com our courses at theanalystacademy.com a quick disclaimer before I get started a quick disclaimer before I get started all of the slides that I use today are all of the slides that I use today are from publicly available sources so if from publicly available sources so if you're interested in looking at the you're interested in looking at the original slide make sure you check those original slide make sure you check those out in the links down below all right so out in the links down below all right so let's take a look at our first slide let's take a look at our first slide this is a slide from McKinsey about the this is a slide from McKinsey about the mining industry and the title says mining industry and the title says successful implementation of Technology successful implementation of Technology could generate up to 22 percent of could generate up to 22 percent of additional value from productivity additional value from productivity Improvement for all stakeholders so Improvement for all stakeholders so essentially what they're saying is by essentially what they're saying is by improving these different Technologies improving these different Technologies we can increase Revenue which is a we can increase Revenue which is a pretty straightforward message and pretty straightforward message and there's enough content on the slide to there's enough content on the slide to support that message really well but support that message really well but where I think this slide could be where I think this slide could be improved is in the overall flow and also improved is in the overall flow and also in removing distractions so for example in removing distractions so for example the very first thing that I think has to the very first thing that I think has to be removed is this terrible picture be removed is this terrible picture right here it doesn't contribute to the right here it doesn't contribute to the slide's message it just distracts the slide's message it just distracts the audience and that's kind of the risk audience and that's kind of the risk with photos sometimes they can make the with photos sometimes they can make the slide look prettier and they do have slide look prettier and they do have their place on occasion but in general their place on occasion but in general they distract the audience and if it's they distract the audience and if it's not contributing to your message it not contributing to your message it should be removed should be removed so the very first step I took was to so the very first step I took was to take out this photo take out this photo then the next thing is just with the then the next thing is just with the overall flow and structure of the slide overall flow and structure of the slide generally people read your slides from generally people read your slides from top to bottom and then from left to top to bottom and then from left to right so you want to set up your content right so you want to set up your content in a way that kind of supports that flow in a way that kind of supports that flow and in general they've done that pretty and in general they've done that pretty well so they've got a nice title here at well so they've got a nice title here at the top then the content the content the top then the content the content then flows over to this chart right here then flows over to this chart right here and they kind of support that with these and they kind of support that with these arrows right here overall pretty good arrows right here overall pretty good but where I think it needs to be but where I think it needs to be improved is with the title first so you improved is with the title first so you want your audience to read the title want your audience to read the title first so that they can grasp the overall first so that they can grasp the overall message of your slide and then it puts message of your slide and then it puts the rest of the details in context the rest of the details in context but the problem here is the title is not but the problem here is the title is not big enough and it's not bold enough big enough and it's not bold enough so first step I took was to just make so first step I took was to just make this title a little bit bigger and a this title a little bit bigger and a little bit Bolder just so it commands a little bit Bolder just so it commands a little bit more attention little bit more attention the second thing is I noticed there's the second thing is I noticed there's quite a bit it's sort of scrunched right quite a bit it's sort of scrunched right here you've got the title up top right here you've got the title up top right here and then this text right here is here and then this text right here is pretty close in size it's pretty close pretty close in size it's pretty close together and it makes it a little bit together and it makes it a little bit harder to read the title first you don't harder to read the title first you don't want people to get distracted so there's want people to get distracted so there's a couple things we can do about this a couple things we can do about this the first is this gray section right the first is this gray section right here only applies to the Chart way over here only applies to the Chart way over here here here so that frees up a little bit of space so that frees up a little bit of space right here right here the next thing I did was to take this the next thing I did was to take this Legend and put it closer to the Chart Legend and put it closer to the Chart because there's nothing above this line because there's nothing above this line right here that the legend applies to so right here that the legend applies to so it's just going to be distracting people it's just going to be distracting people from the title take that Legend move it from the title take that Legend move it down here and the other thing is down here and the other thing is actually in most cases and especially in actually in most cases and especially in this case you don't necessarily need a this case you don't necessarily need a legend when you create a legend for your legend when you create a legend for your charts what you're doing is you're charts what you're doing is you're asking the audience to look at the asking the audience to look at the legend then back to the Chart then back legend then back to the Chart then back to the legend to try and understand each to the legend to try and understand each of the categories it's too much work for of the categories it's too much work for the brain and it's unnecessary so in the brain and it's unnecessary so in this case what I did right here is just this case what I did right here is just put them right next to their actual put them right next to their actual categories High estimate low estimate categories High estimate low estimate much easier to read all right so let's much easier to read all right so let's now take a look at the actual content now take a look at the actual content the main part of the slide which is this the main part of the slide which is this section right here section right here there's a lot of text and having text on there's a lot of text and having text on your slide isn't necessarily bad I think your slide isn't necessarily bad I think especially in slides like this you get a especially in slides like this you get a lot of text Heavy slides because there's lot of text Heavy slides because there's a lot of information that needs to be a lot of information that needs to be communicated communicated communicated but there are ways that we can make this but there are ways that we can make this a little bit easier for the audience to a little bit easier for the audience to read and overall it is a pretty good read and overall it is a pretty good chart I debated for a while here kind of chart I debated for a while here kind of separating this into a column chart like separating this into a column chart like this where you've got your low estimate this where you've got your low estimate and your high estimate but the problem and your high estimate but the problem with a chart like that is it's going to with a chart like that is it's going to suggest that there's kind of this suggest that there's kind of this increase over time from low to high and increase over time from low to high and that's not the message we're trying to that's not the message we're trying to communicate we're trying to portray that communicate we're trying to portray that there's two situations a low estimate there's two situations a low estimate and a high estimate for a total and a high estimate for a total potential Improvement of 22 percent so potential Improvement of 22 percent so actually I think this kind of single actually I think this kind of single column chart does this pretty well if column chart does this pretty well if you have more suggestions for this I'd you have more suggestions for this I'd love to hear your thoughts down in the love to hear your thoughts down in the comments comments comments but one thing that I think can be but one thing that I think can be improved with this column chart is improved with this column chart is there's kind of this equal focus on this there's kind of this equal focus on this number this number and this number and number this number and this number and that just is that doesn't really fit that just is that doesn't really fit with the message we're trying to with the message we're trying to communicate the most emphasis should be communicate the most emphasis should be on this number right here because that's on this number right here because that's what connects with the title so an easy what connects with the title so an easy fix for that is just to make the font fix for that is just to make the font for these a little bit smaller and make for these a little bit smaller and make this one bigger and bold and already I this one bigger and bold and already I think that looks a whole lot better this think that looks a whole lot better this part of the slide is much cleaner it's part of the slide is much cleaner it's much more focused and easier to much more focused and easier to understand the next step is actually a understand the next step is actually a pretty small one it's more just a pretty small one it's more just a formatting change if you notice right formatting change if you notice right down here down here this text is a little bit off so it this text is a little bit off so it doesn't align in the middle doesn't align in the middle and usually that happens because you add and usually that happens because you add this kind of extra line at the end of this kind of extra line at the end of your text without thinking about it and your text without thinking about it and so it messes up the alignment so just a so it messes up the alignment so just a small change there but it bothered me so small change there but it bothered me so I had to change it the next section to I had to change it the next section to talk about is really this main content talk about is really this main content section right here the reason why it's a section right here the reason why it's a little bit challenging to kind of work little bit challenging to kind of work through is because there's a lot of text through is because there's a lot of text and processing a lot of text all at one and processing a lot of text all at one time is pretty difficult especially if time is pretty difficult especially if you're hearing this presentation live you're hearing this presentation live you're trying to listen to what the you're trying to listen to what the speaker's saying think about what you're speaker's saying think about what you're going to say reading through a lot of going to say reading through a lot of text is pretty hard text is pretty hard and contrary to what you might think and contrary to what you might think when you're sitting there looking at a when you're sitting there looking at a slide you're not going to want to read slide you're not going to want to read through every single line you just sort through every single line you just sort of skim through it to try and catch the of skim through it to try and catch the highlights and if it's just text it's highlights and if it's just text it's really hard to skim one pretty simple really hard to skim one pretty simple way that I'm a big fan of is to way that I'm a big fan of is to introduce icons so what I did is I kind introduce icons so what I did is I kind of spaced this out just a little bit of spaced this out just a little bit gave some extra room right here and then gave some extra room right here and then now we can add icons that fit in with now we can add icons that fit in with the message the message of each of these levers when you're of each of these levers when you're reading this text right here it's just reading this text right here it's just that much easier to grasp the content that much easier to grasp the content that you're trying to communicate and that you're trying to communicate and there we go I think this slide is there we go I think this slide is significantly better it might not look significantly better it might not look like a whole lot of changes were made like a whole lot of changes were made and especially because we've been now and especially because we've been now looking at this slide for a few minutes looking at this slide for a few minutes if you're looking at this slide for the if you're looking at this slide for the first time you'd have a much easier time first time you'd have a much easier time actually processing the information on actually processing the information on the slide and trying to get to the key the slide and trying to get to the key insights insights insights all right let's talk about slide number all right let's talk about slide number two two two so this one is about goods and data so this one is about goods and data flows across the globe and it's as you flows across the globe and it's as you can tell it's a pretty straightforward can tell it's a pretty straightforward slide it's just a list of slide it's just a list of recommendations and some of these recommendations and some of these recommendations are supposed to be key recommendations are supposed to be key enablers for digitalization enablers for digitalization and overall this is actually a pretty and overall this is actually a pretty normal slide you might see this at the normal slide you might see this at the end of the deck or sometimes at the end of the deck or sometimes at the beginning of the deck to kind of frame beginning of the deck to kind of frame the entire deck but it's a pretty the entire deck but it's a pretty straightforward slide no charts no straightforward slide no charts no numbers and that's completely fine so numbers and that's completely fine so first let's talk about the overall first let's talk about the overall structure of the slide title on the top structure of the slide title on the top list of recommendations take away down list of recommendations take away down at the bottom again straightforward at the bottom again straightforward totally okay totally okay but where I think this slide could be but where I think this slide could be improved a little bit again is with the improved a little bit again is with the title it's not that bad but there's two title it's not that bad but there's two things that I want to change things that I want to change first is there's plenty of room right first is there's plenty of room right here so we can make this title bigger here so we can make this title bigger and we can make it bolder and we can make it bolder also notice how it kind of goes outside also notice how it kind of goes outside of the margins here of the margins here it just makes for kind of a it just makes for kind of a messy look and I think it should be messy look and I think it should be improved so first step improved so first step was to just improve that was to just improve that and second thing to notice is this and second thing to notice is this Legend right here I think it's trying to Legend right here I think it's trying to indicate that some of these are enablers indicate that some of these are enablers for digitalization some of them are kind for digitalization some of them are kind of enablers and some of them aren't of enablers and some of them aren't enablers at all enablers at all but that message isn't that clear so I but that message isn't that clear so I think we can improve that by instead of think we can improve that by instead of making this kind of a gradient box right making this kind of a gradient box right here have it just apply to here have it just apply to and that doesn't look very good but at and that doesn't look very good but at least logically it makes more sense so least logically it makes more sense so let's take it one step further and try let's take it one step further and try to make it look good to make it look good one way we can do that is by removing one way we can do that is by removing this fill color it just kind of Blends this fill color it just kind of Blends in with this darker Orange right here in with this darker Orange right here I guess doesn't blend in it it more I guess doesn't blend in it it more clashes and so clashes and so if we can improve that just a little bit if we can improve that just a little bit by removing the fill and moving this by removing the fill and moving this Legend down here that's going to look a Legend down here that's going to look a whole lot better so now that we've whole lot better so now that we've removed the legend we've got all this removed the legend we've got all this space right here so we can probably space right here so we can probably space out the slide just a little bit space out the slide just a little bit more I'm going to make the title just a more I'm going to make the title just a tiny bit bigger and kind of space some tiny bit bigger and kind of space some of these sections out a little bit more of these sections out a little bit more so it's easier to read so it's easier to read and if we wanted to we could probably and if we wanted to we could probably leave this slide just like this as it is leave this slide just like this as it is and it would look a whole lot better and and it would look a whole lot better and be completely fine but I think there's a be completely fine but I think there's a few more things we can do first thing is few more things we can do first thing is the text on the slide is kind of hard to the text on the slide is kind of hard to read just because there's a lot of it read just because there's a lot of it less than our last slide but it's hard less than our last slide but it's hard to really understand each of these to really understand each of these recommendations so there's a few options recommendations so there's a few options here one yeah we could just add icons here one yeah we could just add icons like we did on the last slide but with like we did on the last slide but with eight recommendations that's a lot of eight recommendations that's a lot of icons and at that point the icons icons and at that point the icons themselves become distracting and don't themselves become distracting and don't really help the slide so one thing I'm really help the slide so one thing I'm going to try and do here is just split going to try and do here is just split this into two separate sections it's this into two separate sections it's kind of space that text that a little kind of space that text that a little bit more and get rid of some of this bit more and get rid of some of this text to make it more to the point and text to make it more to the point and so now this just applies to this right so now this just applies to this right section right here the text is more section right here the text is more spaced apart spaced apart and it's kind of trimmed down just a and it's kind of trimmed down just a little bit to be again more to the point little bit to be again more to the point and more straightforward but the problem and more straightforward but the problem we have here now is most of the focus is we have here now is most of the focus is coming down to this takeaway box right coming down to this takeaway box right here because it's a bright orange and here because it's a bright orange and some of this text is a little bit more some of this text is a little bit more boring so we need to shift that Focus boring so we need to shift that Focus just a little bit so you focus on the just a little bit so you focus on the recommendations and then the takeaway recommendations and then the takeaway box is kind of the last thing you look box is kind of the last thing you look at because if you look at the content of at because if you look at the content of this takeaway box it's trying to spark a this takeaway box it's trying to spark a conversation it's not really calling conversation it's not really calling attention to information that's already attention to information that's already on the slide so we want the audience to on the slide so we want the audience to look here first look here first focus on this second focus on this second and this last so visually we need to and this last so visually we need to represent that flow represent that flow so one way we can do that is by bringing so one way we can do that is by bringing just a little bit more color into these just a little bit more color into these so now not only the slide a lot easier so now not only the slide a lot easier to process visually but look at the to process visually but look at the logical connection the title is mostly logical connection the title is mostly about this section right here about this section right here and they're both blue so the audience and they're both blue so the audience can make that connection visually it's a can make that connection visually it's a lot easier to process a lot easier to lot easier to process a lot easier to read read read but then the second thing is this point but then the second thing is this point about digitalization connects with the about digitalization connects with the takeaway box and those are both orange takeaway box and those are both orange so again there's kind of a visual and a so again there's kind of a visual and a logical connection there that makes a logical connection there that makes a lot of sense makes this slide a whole lot of sense makes this slide a whole lot easier to read it so compare this lot easier to read it so compare this with our original slide that kind of had with our original slide that kind of had that ugly orange gradient this slide that ugly orange gradient this slide looks a whole lot better it's a lot looks a whole lot better it's a lot cleaner there's less text to kind of cleaner there's less text to kind of clutter our brains there's visual clutter our brains there's visual components drawing attention to the components drawing attention to the parts that really matter and there's parts that really matter and there's less focus on the takeaway box which less focus on the takeaway box which really was just a distraction and then really was just a distraction and then not to mention we removed this really not to mention we removed this really ugly kind of puke orange color that was ugly kind of puke orange color that was confusing and tough to look at so confusing and tough to look at so overall I think this slide looks a whole overall I think this slide looks a whole lot better all right let's take a look lot better all right let's take a look at slide number three this slide again at slide number three this slide again is about the mining industry title says is about the mining industry title says companies are planning for the future companies are planning for the future with technology in mind and expect with technology in mind and expect revenues to keep growing at four percent revenues to keep growing at four percent so again this slide is about technology so again this slide is about technology and its impact on Revenue and its impact on Revenue and the main challenge with this slide and the main challenge with this slide you're probably already thinking it you're probably already thinking it there's just too much going on the there's just too much going on the components of the slider all there they components of the slider all there they support the message the logic is great support the message the logic is great but there's too much going on visually but there's too much going on visually it distracts from the message it makes it distracts from the message it makes it difficult on the audience it difficult on the audience so first thing I'm going to do of course so first thing I'm going to do of course is take out this photo again doesn't is take out this photo again doesn't contribute let's get it out of there contribute let's get it out of there second thing is you may have remembered second thing is you may have remembered this from our first slide but this this from our first slide but this section right here there's just too much section right here there's just too much going on it's all kind of bunched going on it's all kind of bunched together so it's harder to read the together so it's harder to read the title and then move down to the content title and then move down to the content so when I go to read this title I'm also so when I go to read this title I'm also distracted by this text and this text distracted by this text and this text and now I'm kind of getting into the and now I'm kind of getting into the slide or getting into the chart excuse slide or getting into the chart excuse me so we can improve that by just me so we can improve that by just removing this line and kind of moving it removing this line and kind of moving it down a little bit now the title's got down a little bit now the title's got some breathing room some breathing room it makes it a lot easier to understand it makes it a lot easier to understand the next thing is all these lines on the next thing is all these lines on here there's so many lines on this chart here there's so many lines on this chart there's the revenue line which is kind there's the revenue line which is kind of our main focus of our main focus you've got the ebitda line below that you've got the ebitda line below that and then these growth rate lines and then these growth rate lines and these also have their own callouts and these also have their own callouts it's just a lot of lines on the slide it's just a lot of lines on the slide and really if you look at the message we and really if you look at the message we don't need all of these the focus is on don't need all of these the focus is on this four percent this four percent so so so let's delete some of these ones in this let's delete some of these ones in this section right here section right here and already that looks a whole lot and already that looks a whole lot better this puts the focus on this better this puts the focus on this section which is really what we want to section which is really what we want to focus on focus on but of course you still have the data but of course you still have the data for the rest of the slide for the rest of the slide that puts it in the right context that puts it in the right context and actually we can probably take this and actually we can probably take this just one step further and remove this just one step further and remove this down right here because there's no focus down right here because there's no focus on this in the title it's not really on this in the title it's not really important to the overall message so important to the overall message so let's get rid of it let's get rid of it all right now we have the same problem all right now we have the same problem we had from the earlier Slide the legend we had from the earlier Slide the legend is way up here is way up here and that does two things it takes away and that does two things it takes away from this title right here but also it from this title right here but also it makes it harder to understand which line makes it harder to understand which line is which yeah you can come up and look is which yeah you can come up and look at the legend it doesn't take you more at the legend it doesn't take you more than a couple seconds but that's just an than a couple seconds but that's just an extra step that you don't need to make extra step that you don't need to make your audience go through your audience go through so what I'm going to do is not only move so what I'm going to do is not only move it move each of these down here to kind it move each of these down here to kind of match with the lines but I'm also of match with the lines but I'm also going to change them make them a going to change them make them a different color a different font a different color a different font a little bit Bolder and so it kind of little bit Bolder and so it kind of connects with each connects with each so notice what I did here is I made this so notice what I did here is I made this the same color as this and I removed the the same color as this and I removed the dots because you don't need the dots dots because you don't need the dots again this kind of matches with this again this kind of matches with this line it's pretty easy to see it's pretty line it's pretty easy to see it's pretty clear you don't need this Legend right clear you don't need this Legend right here I also made this kegger line just a here I also made this kegger line just a little bit smaller and put the label little bit smaller and put the label right next to it so it's more clear and right next to it so it's more clear and if you didn't notice this average if you didn't notice this average industry ebitda margin I abbreviated industry ebitda margin I abbreviated that a little bit and put it right next that a little bit and put it right next to these bubbles so now we don't need to these bubbles so now we don't need any Legend at all there's space right any Legend at all there's space right here it kind of cleans up the slide just here it kind of cleans up the slide just a little bit makes it a whole lot easier a little bit makes it a whole lot easier to read so let's take a second to to read so let's take a second to consider the type of chart that they consider the type of chart that they chose here they chose a line chart and I chose here they chose a line chart and I think that was actually the right choice think that was actually the right choice because with the line chart it focuses because with the line chart it focuses on the overall trend you see one kind of on the overall trend you see one kind of cohesive line and so it forces the cohesive line and so it forces the audience to focus on what's Happening audience to focus on what's Happening from start to finish versus say like a from start to finish versus say like a column chart you have individual columns column chart you have individual columns and the focus is on each of the columns and the focus is on each of the columns and the difference between those two and the difference between those two columns and that's not really what columns and that's not really what they're trying to focus on right here they're trying to focus on right here they're trying to show you an overall they're trying to show you an overall trend and in particular they're trying trend and in particular they're trying to show you this last section of the to show you this last section of the trend this four percent which again trend this four percent which again connects with the title so a line chart connects with the title so a line chart is the right choice here but one thing I is the right choice here but one thing I think they could have done better here think they could have done better here is distinguish between the historical is distinguish between the historical and the projected data on this chart and the projected data on this chart which happens about right here but which happens about right here but there's nothing on the access labels there's nothing on the access labels there's nothing on the chart itself to there's nothing on the chart itself to indicate which of this is historical and indicate which of this is historical and which of this is projected and I think which of this is projected and I think that's a big miss here because that's an that's a big miss here because that's an important part of the message important part of the message so what I did was just add this simple so what I did was just add this simple line right here that indicates where line right here that indicates where today is so this is projected and today is so this is projected and that's historical it's pretty clear you that's historical it's pretty clear you don't want this to stand out too much don't want this to stand out too much because again going back to our problem because again going back to our problem earlier there's a lot of lines on this earlier there's a lot of lines on this slide and you don't want to distract slide and you don't want to distract more than you need to but information more than you need to but information like this is important to the message like this is important to the message all right a couple more things I'm going all right a couple more things I'm going to do to improve this slide this Gap to do to improve this slide this Gap right here is actually starting to right here is actually starting to bother me so what I did was bother me so what I did was I just move the title over a little bit I just move the title over a little bit this is kind of more of a standard this is kind of more of a standard practice anyway and with the legend gone practice anyway and with the legend gone we can space this out it's a lot easier we can space this out it's a lot easier to read and you know I love a good title to read and you know I love a good title then the next thing that kind of bothers then the next thing that kind of bothers me is this section down here so these me is this section down here so these axis labels it's not immediately clear axis labels it's not immediately clear that these are referring to years like that these are referring to years like yeah if you look at it after a couple yeah if you look at it after a couple seconds of course these are years but I seconds of course these are years but I think we can make that message pop just think we can make that message pop just a little bit more a little bit more by adding these kind of I forget what by adding these kind of I forget what you call these these little apostrophes you call these these little apostrophes to make them very clear that they're to make them very clear that they're years so when you look at this you years so when you look at this you understand right away and then along understand right away and then along with that because we've kind of removed with that because we've kind of removed this percent sign from the label right this percent sign from the label right here if we put it in the actual numbers here if we put it in the actual numbers next to the actual numbers
