I took a thousand real Mackenzie slides I took a thousand real Mackenzie slides and uploaded them to chatbt. Then I just and uploaded them to chatbt. Then I just asked it a bunch of questions and the asked it a bunch of questions and the answers that it gave me were actually answers that it gave me were actually really helpful. I started by just really helpful. I started by just finding as many real slides as I could finding as many real slides as I could get my hands on from places like get my hands on from places like Mackenzie's website, but also from a Mackenzie's website, but also from a website called slidstart.com, which is website called slidstart.com, which is basically like a database of real basically like a database of real consulting slides. I compiled them all consulting slides. I compiled them all together, uploaded them to chatbt, and together, uploaded them to chatbt, and gave it some basic instructions. And gave it some basic instructions. And then I just started asking my questions. then I just started asking my questions. I asked things like, "What's the most I asked things like, "What's the most common slide layout? What's the average common slide layout? What's the average number of words on a slide? What chart number of words on a slide? What chart do they use the most? Then I took all do they use the most? Then I took all the best answers and data points, the best answers and data points, compiled them all together into a list compiled them all together into a list of insights that I thought would of insights that I thought would actually be helpful. Insight number one, actually be helpful. Insight number one, titles are conclusions, not labels. The titles are conclusions, not labels. The average length of a title on a Mackenzie average length of a title on a Mackenzie side, at least from this data set, was side, at least from this data set, was 14 words, which looks like this. 14 words, which looks like this. Obviously, there were some that were Obviously, there were some that were pretty long, like this one, and some pretty long, like this one, and some that were also pretty short. But what that were also pretty short. But what almost all of them had in common is they almost all of them had in common is they were all descriptive. In fact, the GPT were all descriptive. In fact, the GPT tells me 72% of the slides use active tells me 72% of the slides use active voice resultoriented titles. The whole voice resultoriented titles. The whole idea was they're not just trying to idea was they're not just trying to transfer information from their brain to transfer information from their brain to your brain. They're trying to tell you your brain. They're trying to tell you why that information actually matters. why that information actually matters. When you do it this way, you're able to When you do it this way, you're able to tell a clear and consistent story from tell a clear and consistent story from slide to slide. Notice how when you put slide to slide. Notice how when you put these three slides together, it these three slides together, it completes a narrative. First slide is completes a narrative. First slide is about how companies have put innovation about how companies have put innovation on the back burner during crisis like on the back burner during crisis like COVID. But then the next slide talks COVID. But then the next slide talks about how companies who invest in about how companies who invest in innovation during these times actually innovation during these times actually tend to outperform their peers. Then the tend to outperform their peers. Then the last slide continues by talking about last slide continues by talking about how they generate higher economic how they generate higher economic profit. These three slides together, profit. These three slides together, even though they're each separate ideas, even though they're each separate ideas, flow really nicely because of these flow really nicely because of these descriptive titles. One slide leads to descriptive titles. One slide leads to the next and you tell a nice consistent the next and you tell a nice consistent cohesive story. Insight number two, cohesive story. Insight number two, every slide has one job. 62% of slides every slide has one job. 62% of slides delivered one clear, easy to understand delivered one clear, easy to understand message. Here's a perfect example. 74% message. Here's a perfect example. 74% of vulnerable jobs pay less than $40,000 of vulnerable jobs pay less than $40,000 a year. Very simple, clear takeaway a year. Very simple, clear takeaway reflected in the title and supported by reflected in the title and supported by the charts below it. Now, when I brought the charts below it. Now, when I brought in the definition to include compound in the definition to include compound messages or titles like this one that messages or titles like this one that kind of talk about two points under a kind of talk about two points under a single theme, then that number was more single theme, then that number was more like 76%. But regardless of how you like 76%. But regardless of how you define what's a single message versus define what's a single message versus multiple messages, what's clear is that multiple messages, what's clear is that they weren't afraid to use slides. they weren't afraid to use slides. That's because when you use one slide That's because when you use one slide for one message, you put an emphasis on for one message, you put an emphasis on that message without focusing on that message without focusing on anything else. This is actually a really anything else. This is actually a really good example. So, this slide says, "Tech good example. So, this slide says, "Tech companies greatly outperformed companies companies greatly outperformed companies from other sectors." But notice how the from other sectors." But notice how the second part of that message is put into second part of that message is put into a completely different slide. While a completely different slide. While their profile changed, most top 10 tech their profile changed, most top 10 tech companies in 2019 are digital attackers. companies in 2019 are digital attackers. They could have very easily combined They could have very easily combined this into a single slide, but instead this into a single slide, but instead they split it out into multiple slides. they split it out into multiple slides. One slide, one message. Insight number One slide, one message. Insight number three, slides should be simple and three, slides should be simple and clear. For this set of slides, the clear. For this set of slides, the average number of words on a slide was average number of words on a slide was 100 words, which is not that much. To 100 words, which is not that much. To give you an example, this slide right give you an example, this slide right here is 108 words. You've got a main here is 108 words. You've got a main chart in the middle with a little bit of chart in the middle with a little bit of supporting text on the right. And of supporting text on the right. And of course, you got a title on the top. course, you got a title on the top. According to the GPT, only about 15% of According to the GPT, only about 15% of the slides were considered dense, which the slides were considered dense, which they define as greater than 200 words. they define as greater than 200 words. And a lot of these slides were just And a lot of these slides were just appendix slides. Of course, you had appendix slides. Of course, you had really dense slides like this one right really dense slides like this one right here, which is about 500 words. But then here, which is about 500 words. But then on the other end of the spectrum, you on the other end of the spectrum, you have slides like this. This one's only have slides like this. This one's only 46 words. And this connects with the 46 words. And this connects with the idea of one slide, one message. You have idea of one slide, one message. You have an unlimited number of slides. So just an unlimited number of slides. So just emphasize one thing at a time. And one emphasize one thing at a time. And one way they do that is by putting a big way they do that is by putting a big bold easy to understand chart right in bold easy to understand chart right in the center of the slide. Insight number the center of the slide. Insight number four is that they repeated a lot of the four is that they repeated a lot of the same layouts. I took a look at all the same layouts. I took a look at all the different layouts that they used and different layouts that they used and according to the GPT just four layouts according to the GPT just four layouts accounted for about 70% of all the accounted for about 70% of all the slides they used. And that's not just slides they used. And that's not just within one single presentation. That's within one single presentation. That's across the whole data set. The most across the whole data set. The most common layout accounted for 29.7% of all common layout accounted for 29.7% of all the slides. And that was just a single the slides. And that was just a single chart slide. Basic descriptive title on chart slide. Basic descriptive title on the top and then a chart right in the the top and then a chart right in the middle of the slide. And again, this middle of the slide. And again, this goes back to the idea of simplicity. One goes back to the idea of simplicity. One chart, one message, clear descriptive chart, one message, clear descriptive title. The underlying analysis might be title. The underlying analysis might be somewhat complex, but they're not trying somewhat complex, but they're not trying to be complex with how they present that to be complex with how they present that information. They want you to understand information. They want you to understand it and understand what to do with that it and understand what to do with that information. Next, most common layout information. Next, most common layout was actually very similar. Just a single was actually very similar. Just a single chart on the left with bullet points on chart on the left with bullet points on the right. And this accounted for 18.7% the right. And this accounted for 18.7% of all slides. Then after that, you had of all slides. Then after that, you had the two column comparison slide, which the two column comparison slide, which accounted for 12.1% of all slides. And accounted for 12.1% of all slides. And then lastly, what I call a table slide, then lastly, what I call a table slide, which accounted for 10.4% of all slides. which accounted for 10.4% of all slides. These slides can be great when you're These slides can be great when you're trying to put a whole bunch of trying to put a whole bunch of information into a single slide. In a information into a single slide. In a separate YouTube video, I actually separate YouTube video, I actually covered all the major chart types that covered all the major chart types that consulting firms tend to use, so if consulting firms tend to use, so if you're interested, make sure you check you're interested, make sure you check that out. The next insight that was very that out. The next insight that was very obvious was that they use a lot of obvious was that they use a lot of visuals. 71% of slides contained a chart visuals. 71% of slides contained a chart of some kind. And when you include of some kind. And when you include visual frameworks in that number, it visual frameworks in that number, it jumps closer to 80%. And this just jumps closer to 80%. And this just connects with the broadly accepted idea connects with the broadly accepted idea that it's better to show someone than to that it's better to show someone than to tell someone. But then number two, tell someone. But then number two, people tend to trust information when people tend to trust information when you've got hard numbers. And those you've got hard numbers. And those numbers are easier to understand in a numbers are easier to understand in a chart. But even when they didn't have chart. But even when they didn't have numbers, a lot of times they would use a numbers, a lot of times they would use a chart to visually explain an idea. chart to visually explain an idea. They'd show different phases and They'd show different phases and maturity levels and things that just can maturity levels and things that just can be difficult to understand when you only be difficult to understand when you only use text. By the way, if you're looking use text. By the way, if you're looking to build your own highquality, clear, to build your own highquality, clear, and sharp template, I have the perfect and sharp template, I have the perfect recommendation. It's a company called recommendation. It's a company called Preslab. Preslab's a strategic Preslab. Preslab's a strategic presentation consultancy that helps presentation consultancy that helps consultants, corporates, and government consultants, corporates, and government teams transform their ideas into clear teams transform their ideas into clear and structured and impactful and structured and impactful presentations. They do a really good job presentations. They do a really good job of making slides that are not just of making slides that are not just pretty and nice to look at, but well pretty and nice to look at, but well ststructured, easy to follow, and to be ststructured, easy to follow, and to be honest, consistent with the principles honest, consistent with the principles we teach at Analyst Academy. I'm we teach at Analyst Academy. I'm actually in the process of working with actually in the process of working with them right now and I've been super them right now and I've been super impressed. Here's a quick peek at the impressed. Here's a quick peek at the slides we've been putting together. And slides we've been putting together. And as you can tell, it looks really good. as you can tell, it looks really good. As you can imagine, I'm very particular As you can imagine, I'm very particular about the design and the structure and about the design and the structure and everything about my slides and they've everything about my slides and they've been very open to feedback while also been very open to feedback while also providing direction. I really enjoyed providing direction. I really enjoyed working with Preslab. So, if you or your working with Preslab. So, if you or your company is looking to level up your company is looking to level up your presentations and just give them that presentations and just give them that extra design and extra structure impact extra design and extra structure impact that your clients are looking for, then that your clients are looking for, then make sure you check them out. I'll make sure you check them out. I'll include a link down in the description include a link down in the description below. Insight number six, bar charts. below. Insight number six, bar charts. Bar charts, bar charts. Bar charts were Bar charts, bar charts. Bar charts were the most commonly used chart by far. We the most commonly used chart by far. We teach a lot of data visualization at teach a lot of data visualization at Analyst Academy. So, I assumed that bar Analyst Academy. So, I assumed that bar charts would be the most commonly used charts would be the most commonly used chart, but I didn't realize how common. chart, but I didn't realize how common. So, of all the charts that were used, So, of all the charts that were used, bar charts made up 40%. And just by bar charts made up 40%. And just by number of slides, one in three slides number of slides, one in three slides had a bar chart in it. And when I say had a bar chart in it. And when I say bar chart, I mean both horizontal and bar chart, I mean both horizontal and vertical. So, column charts included. vertical. So, column charts included. But even still, that's a lot of bar But even still, that's a lot of bar charts. Next most common chart was a charts. Next most common chart was a line chart. 15.9% of all charts were line chart. 15.9% of all charts were line charts. And I don't have data to line charts. And I don't have data to back this up, but it seems to me like back this up, but it seems to me like McKenzie tends to really like line McKenzie tends to really like line charts more than other companies, so I charts more than other companies, so I can imagine this number is maybe even can imagine this number is maybe even higher than normal. Next is waterfall higher than normal. Next is waterfall charts at 10.8%, I tend to see a lot of charts at 10.8%, I tend to see a lot of waterfall charts in consulting slides. waterfall charts in consulting slides. That's because they're good for a couple That's because they're good for a couple different reasons. They show you how to different reasons. They show you how to get from one value to another, but get from one value to another, but they're also useful for showing the they're also useful for showing the breakdown of a given value. That's breakdown of a given value. That's because you can separate each of the because you can separate each of the different subcomponents of the value and different subcomponents of the value and it's just really clear and easy to it's just really clear and easy to understand. Again, going back to this understand. Again, going back to this idea of taking complex topics or data idea of taking complex topics or data and making them simple for the audience and making them simple for the audience and putting them on one slide. Number and putting them on one slide. Number seven, one chart is enough. I told you seven, one chart is enough. I told you earlier that 71.4% of slides had at earlier that 71.4% of slides had at least one chart. Well, it turns out least one chart. Well, it turns out 42.9% of all the slides had one chart. 42.9% of all the slides had one chart. That means about 59% of slides that used That means about 59% of slides that used a chart only used one chart. Again, a chart only used one chart. Again, simplicity is king. In case you're simplicity is king. In case you're curious, by the way, about 15% of slides curious, by the way, about 15% of slides used two charts, and the rest of the used two charts, and the rest of the slides with charts were three, four, or slides with charts were three, four, or more charts, but those were pretty rare. more charts, but those were pretty rare. Next insight was to use callouts on your Next insight was to use callouts on your chart. About 72% of the charts had some chart. About 72% of the charts had some kind of call out. Of course, all the kind of call out. Of course, all the charts had basic information around charts had basic information around units and timeline and that sort of units and timeline and that sort of thing, but a lot of them went this extra thing, but a lot of them went this extra mile to provide either a text call out mile to provide either a text call out or some sort of visual call out to help or some sort of visual call out to help explain the information or to call explain the information or to call attention to a specific part of the attention to a specific part of the chart that was most important. Then, chart that was most important. Then, aside from all this, there was a bunch aside from all this, there was a bunch of other observations that I don't of other observations that I don't necessarily have data for, but that I necessarily have data for, but that I thought was pretty interesting and thought was pretty interesting and helpful. Number one was just their helpful. Number one was just their minimal use of colors. Certainly within minimal use of colors. Certainly within a given presentation there wasn't a wide a given presentation there wasn't a wide range of colors but then even across range of colors but then even across slides they didn't use a bunch of slides they didn't use a bunch of different colors and when they did use different colors and when they did use color they used it very intentionally color they used it very intentionally either to call attention to a specific either to call attention to a specific insight or they use shading to insight or they use shading to communicate a message things like that. communicate a message things like that. Second but related observation is just Second but related observation is just the design consistency again within each the design consistency again within each presentation but also from slide to presentation but also from slide to slide. Their icons in particular, they slide. Their icons in particular, they all follow the same design language. all follow the same design language. They used a lot of the same colors and They used a lot of the same colors and it was just sort of distraction-free. it was just sort of distraction-free. And this is what you get when you have a And this is what you get when you have a really strong and consistent template. really strong and consistent template. And then lastly, just a good use of top- And then lastly, just a good use of top- down communication. Of course, they put down communication. Of course, they put the description in the title, but then the description in the title, but then that message sort of broke down into that message sort of broke down into subtitles or different sections of the subtitles or different sections of the slide. they tended to follow this kind slide. they tended to follow this kind of grid layout that just made the of grid layout that just made the information easy to understand and easy information easy to understand and easy to follow. Again, just this idea of to follow. Again, just this idea of taking complex topics and making them taking complex topics and making them simple. So, if you want to build better simple. So, if you want to build better slides, write clear titles. Make sure slides, write clear titles. Make sure your slides are simple. Don't overload your slides are simple. Don't overload the audience visually. Usually, one or the audience visually. Usually, one or two charts is best when you're trying to two charts is best when you're trying to communicate a message. Make sure you communicate a message. Make sure you have a general level of consistency and have a general level of consistency and design language. And then lastly, most design language. And then lastly, most importantly, make sure you're focusing importantly, make sure you're focusing on the insights. Why does this on the insights. Why does this information matter for your audience? If information matter for your audience? If you're interested in learning more about you're interested in learning more about consulting side layouts, make sure you consulting side layouts, make sure you check out this video on the screen where check out this video on the screen where we talk about the five most common we talk about the five most common
