say what you will about the Consulting say what you will about the Consulting industry there's one thing they're good industry there's one thing they're good at it's building great PowerPoint slides at it's building great PowerPoint slides it's not just about the design of these it's not just about the design of these slides when done correctly they can be slides when done correctly they can be effective ways to communicate a lot of effective ways to communicate a lot of complex information in a really simple complex information in a really simple and easy to digest way but as a and easy to digest way but as a PowerPoint instructor for the Consulting PowerPoint instructor for the Consulting industry I always wonder to myself could industry I always wonder to myself could these slides be made even better with these slides be made even better with this video I took three high quality this video I took three high quality slides from Bane to see if I could slides from Bane to see if I could redesign them to be more effective I'll redesign them to be more effective I'll show you why I made the changes that I show you why I made the changes that I did for these slides and how you can did for these slides and how you can apply those same tips for your own apply those same tips for your own presentations coming up presentations coming up [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you thank you hey everyone Paul here with analyst hey everyone Paul here with analyst Academy where we provide PowerPoint Academy where we provide PowerPoint presentation design and data presentation design and data visualization training to individuals visualization training to individuals and companies all around the world and companies all around the world if that sounds like something you're if that sounds like something you're interested in make sure you check out interested in make sure you check out our courses over at our courses over at theanalystacademy.com I've also got a theanalystacademy.com I've also got a lot of great free stuff over there so lot of great free stuff over there so make sure you check that out as well make sure you check that out as well alright this first slide is from a alright this first slide is from a presentation all about digital Solutions presentation all about digital Solutions in a post-covet world the title says in a post-covet world the title says customers in isolation spend their time customers in isolation spend their time very differently what it's talking about very differently what it's talking about is what life look like pre-covet and is what life look like pre-covet and what it looks like now so for example what it looks like now so for example with outdoor activities pre-covered with outdoor activities pre-covered people would spend this so much of their people would spend this so much of their day and postcoded they spend this much a day and postcoded they spend this much a decrease of 53 percent there's lots to decrease of 53 percent there's lots to like about this slide one of them this like about this slide one of them this short title short title straight to the point it's good to put a straight to the point it's good to put a descriptive title on your slide but descriptive title on your slide but sometimes people get carried away with sometimes people get carried away with this and put more than they need to I this and put more than they need to I could add a lot of words here to make could add a lot of words here to make this seem more descriptive when in this seem more descriptive when in reality this is the only message they're reality this is the only message they're trying to communicate so short and to trying to communicate so short and to the point I really like it it's also the point I really like it it's also good that the content clearly supports good that the content clearly supports the title so you can see it in this the title so you can see it in this chart down here and especially in these chart down here and especially in these percentages percentages percentages and then last thing icons these are and then last thing icons these are really underrated because they help me really underrated because they help me understand this just a little bit better understand this just a little bit better there's a lot of text in this section there's a lot of text in this section right here so making that text come right here so making that text come alive just a little bit more with even alive just a little bit more with even these just really simple icons is these just really simple icons is helpful but there's quite a few things helpful but there's quite a few things on this slide that just aren't working on this slide that just aren't working for me that I think we need to change for me that I think we need to change the first is the overall layout of the the first is the overall layout of the slide so notice how this section right slide so notice how this section right here tends to be the main focus and it's here tends to be the main focus and it's almost like this chart down here is almost like this chart down here is secondary if you really think about it secondary if you really think about it the most important information on this the most important information on this slide at least as it relates to the slide at least as it relates to the title title title are these percentages down here and yet are these percentages down here and yet they're at the very bottom and pretty they're at the very bottom and pretty small because what these percentages are small because what these percentages are showing are how different things really showing are how different things really are are are and yet and yet it seems like this gets most of the it seems like this gets most of the attention so the first thing I'm going attention so the first thing I'm going to do here is switch this around just a to do here is switch this around just a little bit little bit and even by moving this chart up just a and even by moving this chart up just a little bit it just commands just little bit it just commands just slightly more attention and these slightly more attention and these descriptions now play more of a descriptions now play more of a supporting role supporting role the other thing that kind of bothers me the other thing that kind of bothers me about this slide is their use of color about this slide is their use of color color actually plays a really important color actually plays a really important role on your slide and you want to use role on your slide and you want to use it intentionally here it seems like it intentionally here it seems like they're going from this kind of Darker they're going from this kind of Darker grayish black over to this blue color grayish black over to this blue color and they do the same thing with these and they do the same thing with these descriptions right here descriptions right here and you may or may not have noticed but and you may or may not have noticed but what it's trying to communicate with what it's trying to communicate with that color is that the activities on that color is that the activities on this end of the spectrum are things this end of the spectrum are things we're doing a lot less and on this end we're doing a lot less and on this end of the spectrum we're doing it a lot of the spectrum we're doing it a lot more so there's this kind of gradient more so there's this kind of gradient from these more boring colors to these from these more boring colors to these blue colors blue colors that's all fine and good but I don't that's all fine and good but I don't really like the ordering of this color really like the ordering of this color dark less dark less dark Lighter dark dark less dark less dark Lighter dark less dark lighter it's almost like less dark lighter it's almost like there's a reset right here that there's a reset right here that corresponds corresponds corresponds with this division right here it just with this division right here it just doesn't make a lot of sense to me but doesn't make a lot of sense to me but the much much bigger problem and really the much much bigger problem and really the biggest problem with this whole the biggest problem with this whole slide slide slide is this chart right is this chart right it's a 100 stacked bar chart and what it's a 100 stacked bar chart and what it's trying to do is help us see the it's trying to do is help us see the difference difference difference before and after covid before and after covid in each of these activities so outdoor in each of these activities so outdoor activities is this section right here activities is this section right here what we're doing is we're comparing the what we're doing is we're comparing the length of this length of this versus the length of this versus the length of this and this difference right here and this difference right here is this number is this number the problem with these hundred percent the problem with these hundred percent stacked bar charts is it's hard to stacked bar charts is it's hard to compare the categories against each compare the categories against each other except the ones that are on the other except the ones that are on the very end so a much better choice here very end so a much better choice here would be a clustered bar or a clustered would be a clustered bar or a clustered column chart so that's the next change column chart so that's the next change that I made that I made and notice I also took care of the and notice I also took care of the colors colors colors so now look how easy it is to compare so now look how easy it is to compare these against each other one is clearly these against each other one is clearly shorter or clearly longer than the other shorter or clearly longer than the other even the ones that are really close it's even the ones that are really close it's easy to compare the lengths of these easy to compare the lengths of these different columns different columns and that's going to emphasize the point and that's going to emphasize the point just a little bit better just a little bit better so now we just need to clean up the rest so now we just need to clean up the rest of the slide a little bit better and of the slide a little bit better and trying to emphasize this message a trying to emphasize this message a little bit more clearly so the first little bit more clearly so the first thing is to just make these all the same thing is to just make these all the same color and remove the unnecessary boxes color and remove the unnecessary boxes so now notice how these descriptions and so now notice how these descriptions and these icons they're playing much more of these icons they're playing much more of a supporting role they're not trying to a supporting role they're not trying to be the main character be the main character it almost kind of pulls all of this it almost kind of pulls all of this together together together into one visual into one visual but then now we've got to focus on this but then now we've got to focus on this section right here because like I said section right here because like I said in the beginning this is really what in the beginning this is really what we're trying to focus on these numbers we're trying to focus on these numbers down here and right now it's just not down here and right now it's just not very clear very clear so the next thing I wanted to do was to so the next thing I wanted to do was to use a color that helps inform the size use a color that helps inform the size of each of these numbers so instead I of each of these numbers so instead I put these in oval put these in oval and then use colors that correspond to and then use colors that correspond to the difference so the positive values the difference so the positive values are all in green and the darker the are all in green and the darker the positive value the higher the number positive value the higher the number and then the negative values we could and then the negative values we could have used red here but we've already got have used red here but we've already got red in these columns so instead I use red in these columns so instead I use these gray colors and again there's a these gray colors and again there's a gradient big change to slightly less big gradient big change to slightly less big change change change in reality there's a lot of different in reality there's a lot of different ways we could have done this we ways we could have done this we definitely could have used arrows right definitely could have used arrows right here if we really wanted to here if we really wanted to putting negative arrows on this side we putting negative arrows on this side we could have put these numbers right on could have put these numbers right on top of the columns here top of the columns here but I think this method actually works but I think this method actually works pretty good so notice how much of a pretty good so notice how much of a difference this makes when you compare difference this makes when you compare it with the original slide the chart it with the original slide the chart makes the message much more clear and makes the message much more clear and putting more emphasis on these putting more emphasis on these percentages down here helps drive that percentages down here helps drive that message home as well so in the last message home as well so in the last couple videos I did like this a lot of couple videos I did like this a lot of people were asking how I built these people were asking how I built these slides in other words they wanted me to slides in other words they wanted me to show them the step by step so they can show them the step by step so they can do the exact same things that I did so do the exact same things that I did so here's a time lapse of that video and here's a time lapse of that video and while you're watching that video let me while you're watching that video let me tell you about a tool that I like to use tell you about a tool that I like to use called ampler Ambler is basically a called ampler Ambler is basically a PowerPoint add-in that supercharges your PowerPoint add-in that supercharges your productivity a lot of big name productivity a lot of big name consulting firms use it and it's consulting firms use it and it's something that I personally use and something that I personally use and recommend in fact I use it to build each recommend in fact I use it to build each of these slides you can probably see me of these slides you can probably see me using it in the video right here using it in the video right here my favorite feature by far is the chart my favorite feature by far is the chart Builder it's kind of like other chart Builder it's kind of like other chart Builders you might have heard of but Builders you might have heard of but it's a lot less expensive very feature it's a lot less expensive very feature Rich and Incredibly easy to use the Rich and Incredibly easy to use the really great thing about ampload though really great thing about ampload though is it's really useful for teams you can is it's really useful for teams you can share branding and design tools share branding and design tools templates so you have a consistent look templates so you have a consistent look and feel across all of your and feel across all of your presentations we've actually partnered presentations we've actually partnered with ampler so anyone who enrolls in our with ampler so anyone who enrolls in our Advanced courses gets a free six month Advanced courses gets a free six month subscription but if you're not enrolled subscription but if you're not enrolled in one of our Advanced courses and you in one of our Advanced courses and you still want to try it out I'll include a still want to try it out I'll include a link down below where you can try it out link down below where you can try it out for free for a month there's no credit for free for a month there's no credit card required and it's pretty easy to card required and it's pretty easy to sign up sign up all right this next slide is from a all right this next slide is from a presentation about supply chain Trends presentation about supply chain Trends and it's showing the survey responses to and it's showing the survey responses to the question what changes are you making the question what changes are you making to your supply chain Network to your supply chain Network now this isn't how I would have designed now this isn't how I would have designed this slide but there are a few things this slide but there are a few things about this slide that I like about this slide that I like notice how even though it's a survey notice how even though it's a survey question and really you're just question and really you're just responding you're just showing the responding you're just showing the results to one question they didn't put results to one question they didn't put this in the title it's a common mistake this in the title it's a common mistake to use your survey question and make to use your survey question and make that the title and then have the results that the title and then have the results in the body of the slide but the problem in the body of the slide but the problem is when you do this you're not really is when you do this you're not really making it easy for your audience to pick making it easy for your audience to pick out the key insights but what they've out the key insights but what they've done here is they've put the key Insight done here is they've put the key Insight right here in the title and that's right here in the title and that's exactly what you're supposed to do then exactly what you're supposed to do then just put the question just below that just put the question just below that the next thing I like is they've really the next thing I like is they've really put some life to the survey results here put some life to the survey results here by adding these icons making this text by adding these icons making this text nice and bold it's really easy to see nice and bold it's really easy to see and then also related to that making and then also related to that making these numbers nice and big these numbers nice and big in fact when I looked at this slide for in fact when I looked at this slide for the first time this this is the very the first time this this is the very first thing that I noticed was these first thing that I noticed was these numbers numbers numbers but there are quite a few simple changes but there are quite a few simple changes we can make to improve this slide that's we can make to improve this slide that's going to make it a whole lot more going to make it a whole lot more effective the first is this picture now effective the first is this picture now pictures are not inherently bad you can pictures are not inherently bad you can have pictures on your slide but when have pictures on your slide but when they distract more than they contribute they distract more than they contribute they have to go in this case obviously they have to go in this case obviously the pictures related to supply chains the pictures related to supply chains but how much value is it really adding but how much value is it really adding to this slide not that much so then the to this slide not that much so then the first thing was to delete this and first thing was to delete this and obviously we have to change this text to obviously we have to change this text to Black I also made this just a little bit Black I also made this just a little bit smaller because you want the title to be smaller because you want the title to be the main show here the main show here because like I said that's the key because like I said that's the key message of the slide so you want people message of the slide so you want people to focus on that not necessarily on the to focus on that not necessarily on the question it's important to have the question it's important to have the question there or else this data is kind question there or else this data is kind of meaningless but it's not the main of meaningless but it's not the main point of the slide point of the slide now you may or may not have noticed but now you may or may not have noticed but this is actually a column chart right this is actually a column chart right here I could be crazy but I don't think here I could be crazy but I don't think that's immediately obvious it is now that's immediately obvious it is now maybe that the picture is gone but maybe that the picture is gone but before the picture was gone I don't know before the picture was gone I don't know to me it's not super clear that this is to me it's not super clear that this is a column chart and they're using a a column chart and they're using a column chart to show the results of this column chart to show the results of this data obviously the numbers are very data obviously the numbers are very clear like I said earlier but the fact clear like I said earlier but the fact that this is a column chart to me is not that this is a column chart to me is not as obvious as it should be now the as obvious as it should be now the choice of a column chart is actually a choice of a column chart is actually a good one here because in a regular good one here because in a regular column chart just like in a bar chart column chart just like in a bar chart you can compare these values really you can compare these values really easily against each other and that's easily against each other and that's good for a survey because you can see good for a survey because you can see which one of these is number two number which one of these is number two number three and it's supported by the actual three and it's supported by the actual visual of the chart visual of the chart but like I said this one isn't obvious but like I said this one isn't obvious so in my opinion you need to change this so in my opinion you need to change this either to a bar chart or you need to either to a bar chart or you need to remove it from the edges of the slide remove it from the edges of the slide here here here to make it more obvious so that was the to make it more obvious so that was the next step next step now this might look pretty simple but now this might look pretty simple but remember simple is not bad your main remember simple is not bad your main goal is to communicate your message goal is to communicate your message effectively and if that requires a effectively and if that requires a simple slide it's completely fine now simple slide it's completely fine now the last thing we want to do is put the last thing we want to do is put slightly more emphasis on these two slightly more emphasis on these two that's why in the original chart these that's why in the original chart these icons were red icons were red and actually the colors on the cons and actually the colors on the cons themselves there was a little bit of red themselves there was a little bit of red so we want to emphasize that in our bar so we want to emphasize that in our bar chart here because that's really what chart here because that's really what they're trying to communicate with the they're trying to communicate with the title many retailers are pushing title many retailers are pushing fulfillment closer to Consumers that's fulfillment closer to Consumers that's about these two right here about these two right here so really easy way to do this is to so really easy way to do this is to de-emphasize these bottom bars which de-emphasize these bottom bars which is going to emphasize these I also added is going to emphasize these I also added some Bolding to these to make them a some Bolding to these to make them a little clearer and easier to read and little clearer and easier to read and the result is a pretty straightforward the result is a pretty straightforward and in my opinion really easy to and in my opinion really easy to understand slide you can still see the understand slide you can still see the survey question but now the results put survey question but now the results put much more of an emphasis on the message much more of an emphasis on the message you're trying to communicate slides you're trying to communicate slides aren't just about showing data you can aren't just about showing data you can communicate data in an email slides are communicate data in an email slides are about visually representing the message about visually representing the message you're trying to emphasize and this is you're trying to emphasize and this is actually a really good example of that actually a really good example of that you're showing the data but you're you're showing the data but you're putting an emphasis on what you want putting an emphasis on what you want them to take away from that data in this them to take away from that data in this version in my opinion does that a lot version in my opinion does that a lot more effectively all right this last more effectively all right this last slide is from an article about consumer slide is from an article about consumer businesses in Asia Pacific and this businesses in Asia Pacific and this slide in particular is about overseas slide in particular is about overseas versus domestic growth for companies versus domestic growth for companies headquartered in China companies headquartered in China companies headquartered in Japan and companies headquartered in Japan and companies headquartered elsewhere but this is all headquartered elsewhere but this is all based on the top 50 based on the top 50 companies in APAC now what I like about companies in APAC now what I like about this slide is really just the overall this slide is really just the overall clean professional look button actually clean professional look button actually does this really well for the articles does this really well for the articles on their website but also for their on their website but also for their client presentations client presentations it's nice and clean there's not too many it's nice and clean there's not too many colors here it's very straightforward colors here it's very straightforward the red emphasizes what they want you to the red emphasizes what they want you to look at first there's a good use of look at first there's a good use of Bolding and the other really good thing Bolding and the other really good thing is their font hierarchy and what I mean is their font hierarchy and what I mean by that is the most important text on by that is the most important text on the slide is also the largest and it the slide is also the largest and it kind of goes down from there so this is kind of goes down from there so this is a little bit smaller a little bit a little bit smaller a little bit smaller smaller smaller I guess this small smallest I guess this small smallest and also generally speaking the and also generally speaking the important stuff is bold important stuff is bold and then this stuff is not bold and then this stuff is not bold and that's a really subtle thing but it and that's a really subtle thing but it actually impacts how I'm viewing the actually impacts how I'm viewing the slide it directs me to what's important slide it directs me to what's important and directs me away from the stuff and directs me away from the stuff that's not as important that's not as important then the last thing that I really like then the last thing that I really like here is notice how in these charts here is notice how in these charts they're all scaled to the same size so they're all scaled to the same size so there's a lot of empty space right here there's a lot of empty space right here they could have made this chart bigger they could have made this chart bigger change this axis but instead they kept change this axis but instead they kept these all at the same level that way we these all at the same level that way we can compare them across each other which can compare them across each other which is a subtle thing but it makes a big is a subtle thing but it makes a big difference when you're not trying to difference when you're not trying to misrepresent the data my main issue with misrepresent the data my main issue with this slide is actually the title which this slide is actually the title which is something you really don't want to is something you really don't want to get wrong in your slides are you saying get wrong in your slides are you saying china-based companies grew the fastest china-based companies grew the fastest overseas full stop or are you saying for overseas full stop or are you saying for overseas growth overseas growth china-based companies did the best china-based companies did the best to me it's that one in other words I to me it's that one in other words I think they're trying to say 17 is think they're trying to say 17 is greater than six and five greater than six and five but again it's not very clear but again it's not very clear the other thing is this second half the other thing is this second half which to me is also unclear which to me is also unclear so it's saying while japan-based so it's saying while japan-based consumer product companies use offshore consumer product companies use offshore business to drive Top Line growth and business to drive Top Line growth and they use the word offshore they use the word offshore which is really the same as overseas I which is really the same as overseas I don't know why they use two different don't know why they use two different words but they're trying to say that words but they're trying to say that this was pretty high and it kind of this was pretty high and it kind of offset this so overall a confusing title offset this so overall a confusing title that's the first change that I made was that's the first change that I made was to adjust this to adjust this so now it says overseas revenue for so now it says overseas revenue for china-based companies grew faster so china-based companies grew faster so this versus the SMS this versus the SMS then overseas revenue from other APAC then overseas revenue from other APAC companies companies companies separating it because these are two separating it because these are two separate ideas separate ideas japan-based consumer products companies japan-based consumer products companies used overseas growth same word so it's used overseas growth same word so it's not confusing to offset not confusing to offset domestic losses I still think there's domestic losses I still think there's too much going on in this title but at too much going on in this title but at least it's a little bit more clear least it's a little bit more clear all right so the next thing to look at all right so the next thing to look at is their choice of chart what they used is their choice of chart what they used are stacked column charts which usually are stacked column charts which usually is good for showing the overall value of is good for showing the overall value of each of these years each of these years and secondarily you can see the and secondarily you can see the breakdown in values breakdown in values but it's hard for me to compare this but it's hard for me to compare this versus this versus this versus this because they're all sitting versus this because they're all sitting on top of these gray columns on top of these gray columns so instead what I'm going to do is put so instead what I'm going to do is put them all in a line chart them all in a line chart now line charts tend to be good when now line charts tend to be good when you're trying to show change over time you're trying to show change over time and it works here because what we're and it works here because what we're showing is the overseas revenue for showing is the overseas revenue for these china-based companies grew at a these china-based companies grew at a faster rate than for these other faster rate than for these other companies so if the company is based in companies so if the company is based in Japan and the companies headquartered Japan and the companies headquartered elsewhere in Asia Pacific you can see elsewhere in Asia Pacific you can see that mentioned in the title grew faster that mentioned in the title grew faster than overseas revenue from other Apec than overseas revenue from other Apec companies and you can see that pretty companies and you can see that pretty well here with this well here with this line chart line chart we made China red so it pops just a we made China red so it pops just a little bit more and it's clearly growing little bit more and it's clearly growing at a faster rate than at a faster rate than Japan Japan Japan and certainly more than the companies and certainly more than the companies that are based elsewhere but I think we that are based elsewhere but I think we can make this message even more clear can make this message even more clear right now this chart is focused on right now this chart is focused on Revenue an absolute number which is why Revenue an absolute number which is why we have this y-axis right here but we have this y-axis right here but instead what we want to focus on is the instead what we want to focus on is the change in growth and I did that by change in growth and I did that by creating what's called an index chart in creating what's called an index chart in other words I took the revenue of all other words I took the revenue of all these companies put it at 100 these companies put it at 100 that way you could see the change in that way you could see the change in growth growth growth for each of these different segments for each of these different segments so this y-axis right here represents the so this y-axis right here represents the percentage of that segment's 2012 percentage of that segment's 2012 Revenue right here now instead of Revenue right here now instead of comparing the absolute revenue between comparing the absolute revenue between each of these segments now we can each of these segments now we can compare the growth changes and look at compare the growth changes and look at this big difference right here this is this big difference right here this is the message we're trying to emphasize the message we're trying to emphasize china-based companies grew faster and china-based companies grew faster and it's very clear with this chart it's very clear with this chart believe it or not creating an index believe it or not creating an index chart is actually really simple for each chart is actually really simple for each segment all I did was take the revenue segment all I did was take the revenue for that year divided by the original for that year divided by the original year and multiply by 100. so for this year and multiply by 100. so for this First Column 16 divided by 16 multiplied First Column 16 divided by 16 multiplied by a hundred by a hundred and then I just copied that over to the and then I just copied that over to the other columns and copied it down for the other columns and copied it down for the different rows then take those values different rows then take those values paste them in the original place paste them in the original place and now we have our index chart and now we have our index chart all right the final issue is this all right the final issue is this section right here in my opinion we section right here in my opinion we should actually just cut this off I should actually just cut this off I don't think it's that insightful I would don't think it's that insightful I would rather just have a slide that focuses on rather just have a slide that focuses on this this first part of the message this this first part of the message but if you wanted to include them both but if you wanted to include them both on the same slide all you would have to on the same slide all you would have to do is just bring back that original do is just bring back that original chart chart chart put it right here that way you have this put it right here that way you have this side of the slide that focuses on this side of the slide that focuses on this and then this side of the slide and then this side of the slide that focuses on this that focuses on this what I would rather do is just have one what I would rather do is just have one slide per message slide per message so this message clearly represented with so this message clearly represented with this chart this chart and then this message clearly and then this message clearly represented with this chart compare represented with this chart compare these to the original slide and the these to the original slide and the messages come through a lot more clearly messages come through a lot more clearly they're a lot easier to understand they're a lot easier to understand all right that's going to do it for all right
